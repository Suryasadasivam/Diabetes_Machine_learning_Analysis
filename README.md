# Diabetes_Machine_learning_Analysis

**Overview**

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Diabetes Prediction" dataset using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to predicting diabetes, including gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status. Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

**Description**

The "Diabetes Prediction" dataset contains information about factors associated with diabetes prediction. Each entry represents a unique individual's health information and includes the following columns:

- gender: Gender of the individual.
- age: Age of the individual.
- hypertension: Whether the individual has hypertension (Yes or No).
- heart_disease: Whether the individual has heart disease (Yes or No).
- smoking_history: Smoking history of the individual.
- bmi: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the individual.
- HbA1c_level: HbA1c level of the individual.
- blood_glucose_level: Blood glucose level of the individual.
- diabetes: Diabetes status (Yes or No).

**Repository Structure**

- diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv: Contains the raw data file used in the analysis.
- s.ipynb: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, analysis, and prediction.
